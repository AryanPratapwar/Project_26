 HOW TO MAKE A RED VELVET CAKE
 
 
 A Red Velvet Cake is instantly recognizable with its bright red color offset by a white Cream Cheese Frosting. There are many theories as to its origin. Some say it originated in the South, others say it originated in the North. All we really know for sure is that it has been a favorite for decades.   


Once the Red Velvet Cake has been baked and cooled, I like to chill the layers in the refrigerator until firm before filling and frosting the cake. This extra step makes the spreading of the frosting a much easier task, as a freshly baked cake is quite fragile and when you try to spread the frosting there is a tendency for the cake to tear. Refrigerating the cake first eliminates this problem. 

I love to frost a Red Velvet Cake with a Cream Cheese Frosting. But the Cream Cheese Frosting I use is a little different than most. What makes it different is that besides cream cheese, it also contains mascarpone cheese and whipped cream. This makes the frosting deliciously rich and creamy. Now, Mascarpone cheese is an Italian cheese that is thick, buttery-rich, delicately sweet and velvety. It is often sold in plastic 8-ounce (227 grams) tubs. You may find it in specialty food stores or in the deli section of your local grocery store. If you cannot find Mascarpone just substitute with 8 ounces (227 grams) of cream cheese. This frosting recipe is adapted from 'The Waldorf-Astoria Cookbook' by John Doherty.
Red Velvet Cake: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Butter two - 9 inch (23 cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper.
